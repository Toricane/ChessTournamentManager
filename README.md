<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Manage Chess Tourney Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://managechesstourney.netlify.app/)

This is a fun little Swiss system chess tournament manager I made for my friends and I to use when we play chess tournaments.

The tournament manager uses the Swiss system, which is a system of pairing players in a tournament based on their scores. The Swiss system is used in many chess tournaments, including the World Chess Championship.
